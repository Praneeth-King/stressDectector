# Stress Detection Using Machine Learning and Image Processing Techniques  

The primary goal of our project is to detect and manage stress among IT professionals using advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Image Processing techniques. This system represents an enhanced version of traditional stress detection solutions, incorporating live detection capabilities and periodic analysis for improved accuracy and effectiveness.  

Unlike older systems that excluded live detection and personal counseling, our approach integrates these features to create a more comprehensive solution. The system periodically analyzes employees' stress levels—both physical and mental—through image-based detection. It also provides survey forms at regular intervals to monitor changes over time and suggest tailored remedies for stress management. This ensures a healthier and more productive work environment while optimizing employee performance during working hours.  

Key components of our system include:  
- **Image Processing:** At the initial stage, an employee's image is captured through the system's interface (e.g., a browser). This image is converted into digital form for processing. Techniques such as enhancement and feature extraction are applied to obtain useful characteristics.  
- **Machine Learning:** The processed image data is fed into Machine Learning algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers, to classify the stress levels based on emotional expressions.  
- **Emotion Detection:** The system categorizes emotions into predefined states—such as Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, and Sad—that indicate stress levels. These emotions are displayed visually in a rounded box on the user interface.  

Our innovative approach combines real-time stress detection, periodic assessments, and practical stress management solutions to foster a healthy and dynamic workplace for IT professionals."# stressDectector"
